AWS instances:
    1. ECE1779Master 18.205.87.91
    2. ECE1779Database 34.202.92.63
    3. ECE1779PrimaryWorker 54.227.126.13

    These instances have fixed IP address. So no need to modify anything after they are fully up.
    Also, 1 classic load balancer was created for request handling.
    ECE1779LoadBalancer ECE1779LoadBalancer-2091637738.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com 34.197.138.222

Deployment instructions:
    0.  login into AWS management console with the provided credentials.
    1.  start the 3 instances mentioned above, wait for them to be fully up (status checks passed)
    2.  ssh into master instance
	    2.0.  open a new terminal, and use the following command
              ssh -i <path to key>/ece1779a1_instance.pem ubuntu@18.205.87.91
        2.1.  cd Desktop/ECE1779A1
        2.2.  kick off the master application. command:
              . run_master.sh
    3. ssh into the primary worker instance
	    3.0.  open a new terminal, and use the following command
              ssh -i <path to key>/ece1779a1_instance.pem ubuntu@54.227.126.13 -L 5901:localhost:5901
        3.1.  cd Desktop/ECE1779A1
        3.2.  kick off the worker application. command:
              . run_worker.sh

To stop the web app:
    0.  wipe out all application data and normal worker instances by clicking the "wipe out everything" button on the admin console page of master app
    1.  stop the process by press ctrl + C at the same time, or kill the process.
    2.  exit the ssh session
    3.  stop the AWS instances (Please do not forget to stop the aws instances :) )

How to access the web application (after deployment):
    Port 8080 of the AWS instances is opened for HTTP access.
    For master app:
        1. From the AWS instance, open any type of browser (firefox), type 'http://0.0.0.0:8080/' in the address bar.
        2. From your computer, open any type of browser, type 'http//18.205.87.91:8080/' in the address bar.
    For worker app:
        1. From the worker AWS instance, open any type of browser (firefox), type 'http://0.0.0.0:8080/' in the address bar.
        2. From you computer, open any type of browser, type 'http://ECE1779LoadBalancer-2091637738.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com' in the address bar.

How to use the load generator on the load balancer:
    0. Assume the user (of the image uploader app) is pre-created on the web site
    1. Use vnc client to connect to ECE1779PrimaryWorker
    2. open terminal on instance's desktop
    3. type "cd ece1779/loadbalancer"
    4. type: "java -cp . ece1779.loadgenerator.LoadGenerator 34.197.138.222 80 <userid> <password>"
    5. a window will pop out with options to start worker, stop worker

For checking access log of instances:
    1. get the instance IP address <IP>
    2. ssh into the instance
	    2.0. open a new terminal and use the following command
	        ssh -i <path to key>/ece1779a1_instance.pem ubuntu@<IP>
	    2.1.  cd Desktop/ECE1779A1
	    2.2.  vi access.log
