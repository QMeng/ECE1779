AWS instances:
    1. ECE1779Master 18.205.87.91
    2. ECE1779Database 34.202.92.63
    3. ECE1779PrimaryWorker 54.227.126.13

    These instances have fixed IP address. So no need to modify anything after they are fully up.
    Also, 1 classic load balancer was created.
    ECE1779LoadBalancer ECE1779LoadBalancer-2091637738.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com

Deployment instructions:
    0.  login into AWS management console with the provided credentials.
    1.  start the 3 instances mentioned above, wait for them to be fully up (status checks passed)
    2.  open a terminal, use the following command to ssh into master instance
            ssh -i <path to key>/ece1779a1_instance.pem ubuntu@18.205.87.91
        2.1.  cd Desktop/ECE1779A1
        2.2.  kick off the master application. command:
            . run_master.sh
    3. open a new terminal, use the following command to ssh into the primary instance
            ssh -i <path to key>/ece1779a1_instance.pem ubuntu@54.227.126.13 -L 5901:localhost:5901
        2.1.  cd Desktop/ECE1779A1
        2.2.  kick off the worker application. command:
            . run_worker.sh

To stop the web app:
    1.  stop the process by press ctrl + C at the same time, or kill the process.
    2.  exit the ssh session
    3.  stop the AWS instances (Please do not forget to stop the aws instance :) )

How to access the web application (after deployment):
    Port 8080 of the AWS instances is opened for HTTP access.
    For master app:
        1. From the AWS instance, open any type of browser (firefox), type 'http://0.0.0.0:8080/' in the address bar.
        2. From your computer, open any type of browser, type 'http//18.205.87.91:8080/' in the address bar.
    For worker app:
        1. From the AWS instance, open any type of browser (firefox), type 'http://0.0.0.0:8080/' in the address bar.
        2. From you computer, open any type of browser, type 'http://ECE1779LoadBalancer-2091637738.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com' in the address bar.
